# First APK for React Native

<p>Began learning React Native.  Getting to this point was difficult, but it can be done. Will write a tutorial soon.</p>
<p>Most of my time as been spent figuring out how to build without using Android Studio.  It consumes too many resources on my laptop.</p>
<p>However, I finally stumbled across Expo-CLI (https://expo.dev).  I had to get some help and their folks were able to correct my mistakes.</p>
<p>This is my second build and it worked.  There is an APK file included in the repo. Doesn't do much as it was a learning file. Yet, it allowed me to use some React knowledge to do a little.</p>
<p>Will post a workflow soon.</p>
